# About this startpage

This startpage is meant to be a place where people can come to do their daily searches while also being informed about the lunar phases. Overall, it was great practice for React and Bootstrap, and it was fun to work on!

# Features

You can add links to the startpage by clicking the "Add a Link" button in the upper left corner. You can then add the hyperlink for it to take you to (you can omit the 'https://' if you'd like) as well as the alias, or the name you would like for it to display under.

# The Absolute Coolest Thing About This Startpage

Yes, the startpage is quite handy. Being able to set your links to what you'd like and use them at your whim is great. However, I did not wanna just stop there.

The background has a day / night cycle, and also has a full simulation going on. Everything you see was made from the ground up in a mixture of React and vanilla JS (with, again, Bootstrap for the UI).

# To-Do

There are a lot of features I plan to have:

- Better optimization
- More browser compatibility (right now, it only seems to work on Chrome)
- Fixing the small memory leak React warns me about
- Adding a bit more variety to the background
- A weather system that persists when you close the tab and immediately reopen it (similar to how the day/night cycle currently works)
